## Troubleshooting Leaflet Map Rendering Issues in an Angular Application

**Problem:**

A Leaflet map is not rendering correctly in an Angular application. The map container is either not visible, or it is only partially visible in the top-left corner of the screen. The map tiles are not loading correctly.

**Symptoms:**

- The map container is small and in the top-left corner.
- The map tiles are not loading, or only a small portion is visible.
- The map does not respond to user interaction.

**Cause:**

This issue is often caused by a conflict between Leaflet's CSS and the application's global styles, especially when using a UI library like Angular Material. The most common cause is the use of CSS `transform` properties on parent elements of the map container, which interferes with Leaflet's positioning of map tiles.

**Solution:**

1. **Isolate the issue:** Create a minimal, isolated component with only the map to confirm that the issue is with the global styles.
2. **Check for conflicting CSS:** Systematically review and disable global CSS rules that might be causing the issue. Pay close attention to `transform` and `position` properties.
3. **Override conflicting styles:** If a conflicting style is found, either remove it or create a more specific override that targets only the necessary elements and does not interfere with Leaflet.
4. **Ensure correct map initialization:**
    - Initialize the map in the `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook to ensure that the map container is rendered before the map is initialized.
    - Call `map.invalidateSize()` after the map is initialized to force it to recalculate its size. This can be done inside a `setTimeout` to ensure that the container has been fully rendered.

**Example Code:**

```typescript
// map.component.ts
import { Component, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';
import * as L from 'leaflet';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-map',
  template: '<div id="map" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;"></div>',
  styles: [':host { display: block; height: 400px; }']
})
export class MapComponent implements AfterViewInit {
  private map!: L.Map;

  ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    this.map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
      attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    }).addTo(this.map);

    setTimeout(() => {
      this.map.invalidateSize();
    }, 0);
  }
}
```

```css
/* styles.css */
/* Look for and disable conflicting styles like these */

/* .some-container * { */
/*   transform: none !important; */
/* } */
```
